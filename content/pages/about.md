# So who am I?

The name's Winter, though that's my online name, dont plan to give out my real name here. I am a programmer that works with Rust, C++, Python, Java, and C#. Though im always dabbling with new projects and languages all the time.

Im a furry, though I usually keep this to myself in real life as I see it as kind of cringe to wear a fursuit or saw "UwU" in public, I keep it professional y'know?

# Interests?

Well I clearly like programming and am a furry so uhh... machine learning I guess? I like to mess around with AI models and even build/train my own. I have many projects on my computer and on github showing what I can do.
Im also a big privacy advocate, I hate when big corps try to strip away our privacy for profit. 

# Political stances?

The opposite of yours.

# Sona?
For the normies/non-furries this is where you should scroll away, it aint NSFW but I know some people will cringe if they see any furry art and I can respect that. 



##### What is he? 
Certainly a grey cat, thinking tabby or some kind of tiger. Either way he's a cat.
